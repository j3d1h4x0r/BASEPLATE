- Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
- Machine learning fundamentals with scikit-learn
- Jupyter notebook best practices
- Real-world data science projects

## 🛠 Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of basic statistics and mathematics
- Familiarity with command line operations
- A curious mind and willingness to learn!

## 📦 Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:j3d1h4x0r/BASEPLATE.git
cd BASEPLATE
```

### 2. Set Up Python Environment
We recommend using conda or virtualenv to manage dependencies:

**Using conda:**
```bash
conda create -n data-science python=3.9
conda activate data-science
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Using virtualenv:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Launch Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
